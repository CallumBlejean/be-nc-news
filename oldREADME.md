To run this project locally, you will need to set up environment variables for two databases, the development database and the test database.
Create the enviroment files : In the root of the project, create two files named .env.development and .env.test.
Each file should contain a single environment variable pointing to the respective database.
Replace your_database with the name of your databases:
PGDATABASE=your_database_test
PGDATABASE=your_database_development
